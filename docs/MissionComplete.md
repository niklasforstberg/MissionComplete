    {
        _logger.LogWarning("Invalid login attempt");
        return BadRequest("Invalid credentials");
    }
    var user = await _userService.Authenticate(request.Email, request.Password);
    if (user == null)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning($"Failed login attempt for {request.Email}");
        return Unauthorized("Invalid credentials");
    }
    return Ok(new { Token = _jwtService.GenerateToken(user) });
}

        return BadRequest("Invalid input");
    }
    var result = await _teamService.CreateTeam(team);
    return Ok(result);
}
```
```csharp
[HttpPost("/api/challenges")]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateChallenge([FromBody] ChallengeDto challenge)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)

  ```dockerfile
  # Build stage
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
  WORKDIR /src
  COPY . .
  RUN dotnet restore
  RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

  # Runtime stage
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=build /app .
  ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MissionComplete.dll"]
  ```
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated CI/CD pipeline
  ```yaml
  name: CI/CD
  on:
    push:
      branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]
  
  jobs:
    build-and-deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Build and test
          run: |
            docker build -t mission-complete .
            docker run mission-complete dotnet test
        - name: Deploy
          if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
          run: |
            docker tag mission-complete registry.example.com/mission-complete
            docker push registry.example.com/mission-complete
  ```

## 7. Conclusion
